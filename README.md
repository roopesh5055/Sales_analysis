# Sales_analysis
Here I am analyzing the sales and profit data of ‘The Coffee Cup’. The Coffee Cup is a Canadian Coffee company with different branches all over the nation. They sell different verities of coffee as well as tea. 
Here, the sales and profit data of this company from its different branches in 2012, 2018, and 2019 are used for the analysis.
Our motive is to deeply analyze the business and find out the potential stores that generate the highest profit, and also to find out the weakness of this organization. Finally, provide key insights and suggestions for the management to improve their business.

Microsoft Power BI is used to create the reports.
The pages created for the analysis are:
1. Summary page
2. Sales Analysis page
3. Gross Profit Analysis page
4. Net Profit Analysis page
5. Individual Store Analysis page
